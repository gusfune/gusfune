The thing no one is talking about AI in Software Engineering is probably the one detail that we should be paying more attention: communication skills.

AI is not going to replace jobs, but engineers that can't communicate well, they are going to lag behind. Learning a new tool, a new programming language or a new way of working, that's mostly hard skills, that's easy to train and nail.

Communication is a soft skill. It's behaviour and it's about conveying ideas and information that are unstructured into a way that can be understood and actionable. It's not impossible to train for, it's harder, it takes more time and it's less objective, which, can be annoying for the lot more of logical thinkers.

While everyone is trying to master the tools of AI, my recommendation: improve communication. Learn to write better, learn to cut the noise. It's not only about interpersonal skills, it's also helping to write better prompts, better comments, and better documentation if we're still doing that soon.
