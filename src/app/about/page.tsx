        <p>
          If you are here, you probably know something about me. I&#39;m Gus, a
          tech/business person that likes buinding things, and companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have no formal technical background, like a CS or engineering
          degree, but, I am &quot;self-taught&quot; or at least
          &quot;home-schooled&quot; into programming. I always had computers,
          internet and, watched my dad programming and asked a ton of annoying
          questions (or maybe I was raised as a Rubber Duck, who knows?).
        </p>
        <p>
          I&#39;ve bult a few companies, some did well, some didn&#39;t. Moved
          countries, twice, and in the last few years focused into e-commerce
          and retail.
        </p>
        <p className="font-light italic">
          *So if you didn&#39;t study CS or engineering, what did you do? Oh, I
          studied Advertising and Film Production in college. Later on, I did
          study game design and development and did an MBA. But, most of things
          I learned, were from hands-on experience.
