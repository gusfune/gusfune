# About

If you are here, you probably know something about me. I'm Gus, a tech/business person that likes buinding things, and companies.
I have no technical background, like a CS or engineering degree, but, I am "self-taught" or at least "home-schooled" into programming, as since I remember, I always had computers, internet and, watched my dad programming and asked a ton of annoying questions (or maybe I was raised as a Rubber Duck, who knows?).
I've bult a few companies, some did well, some didn't. Moved countries, twice, and in the last few years focused into e-commerce and retail.

*So if you didn't study CS or engineering, what did you do? Oh, I studied Advertising and Film Production in college. Later on, I did study game design and development and did an MBA. But, most of things I learned, were from hands-on experience.

On the non-professional side:
- I'm from Bras√≠lia, capital of Brazil üáßüá∑.
- I live in Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø, in the Kingdom of Fife with my wife and my cat Bilbo
- I am an avid gamer üïπÔ∏è and collector of Lego
- I also am a 3rd kyu judoka ü•ã.
