  > You are probably a leading IT firm based in a country known for cheap labor and loose regulation, but you call it cost-effective or competitive. You are very liberal with hyperboles and the promise seems to be good to be true. You will tell me about success stories about some generic companies. It always includes a local telecom company.

  > Sometimes you detail your stack, which is a wide range of non-connecting things, or you add a bunch of hype words in hopes someone will fall for that. AR, VR, Gamification, Big data, the cloud, the works!

  > And to wrap up, you mention you have an office in a country in the EU or the US so you can be closer to the client, but with no regard to your developers working during night shifts. And you really want an answer to set up a meeting ASAP.

  ## Does that sound familiar?
  Yes, I get a bunch of this every day. Sometimes the same email comes to my personal and business address at the same time. Sometimes the person sends a whole chain of emails in a desperate attempt to call for attention.

  This won't work. If you sent a message like that, it's time for a reflection.

  ## Why your offer isn't appealing?
  A lot of people will fall for the "very cheap labor" fallacy, but we all know that this low price comes at another cost. Developers will be working under stress, with long journeys and low wage. Sometimes a low wage in a country means a livable wage in another country, but let's face the fact that a company charging less than US$ 15/ hour, a developer will get a small chunk of that.

  And finally, most critical outsourcing sales come from networking and recommendation. No sane manager will ever hire a company that they met through soliciting.

  So please stop this madness.

  ## Can I use this message?

  Yes!
