# Hi, I'm Gus Fune

I'm a CTO who delivered over 100 products to scale. Currently I am making e-commerce amazing as CTO of [divbrands](https://div-brands.com) working from Edinburgh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧. Previously I was CTO and Co-founder of [Off Script](https://offscript.io/) an e-commerce startup in Stockholm 🇸🇪, considered by Wired UK as one of the [Hottest European Startups of 2021](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/europe-hottest-startups-2021). And before that I was CTO and Co-Founder of [Wololo/Talkative](https://www.talkative.media/).

I can fix hard-to-find bugs, test design changes in the browser, and automate anything my team needs to get done faster.

I’ve delivered over 100 projects for clients like 3M, Coca-Cola, Behold Studios, BMW, Heineken, McDonald's and Motorola. I’ve also worked with early-stage startups on everything from product research to hiring, team-building, and even accounting.
